Get Ready to Wiggle
We've been ready for so long
Get Ready to Wiggle
When you wiggle you can't go wrong
Get Ready to Wiggle
Wiggle will make you big and strong
Get Ready to Wiggle
Come on wiggle to this song
Wiggle to this song
(Bomp bomp bomp)
We're ready to wiggle
Wiggle your fingers high in the sky
We're ready to wiggle
Wiggle your ears and wiggle your eyes
We're ready to wiggle
Wiggle your hair and wiggle your nose
We're ready to wiggle
Come on wiggle all ten toes
Wiggle all ten toes
(Baa da ba da ba dum)
Wiggle and wiggle
Wiggle at home without a care
Wiggle and wiggle
Wiggle alone or with your teddy bear
Wiggle and wiggle
Wiggle at breakfast lunch or tea
Wiggle and wiggle
Wiggle along with me
Thatâ€™s right wiggle along with me
(Ba damp ba bamb ba damp ba damp)
