Lavender's blue, dilly, dilly
Lavender's green
When I am king, dilly, dilly
You shall be queen
Who told you so, dilly, dilly
Who told you so?

'Twas my own heart, dilly, dilly
That told me so
Call up your men, dilly, dilly
Set them to work
Some to the plough, dilly, dilly
Some to the fork

Some to make hay, dilly, dilly
Some to cut corn
While you and I, dilly, dilly
Keep ourselves warm
Lavender's green, dilly, dilly
Lavender's blue

If you love me, dilly, dilly
I will love you
Let the birds sing, dilly, dilly
And the lambs play
We shall be safe, dilly, dilly
Out of harm's way

I love to dance, dilly, dilly
I love to sing
When I am queen, dilly, dilly
You'll be my king
Who told me so, dilly, dilly
Who told me so?
I told myself, dilly, dilly
I told me so
