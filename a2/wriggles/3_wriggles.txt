Open, shut them, open, shut them
Give a little clap
Open, shut them, open, shut them
Lay them in your lap
Creep them, creep them, creep them
Right up to your chin
Open up your little mouth
*Gasp*
But do not let them in

Now this time let's sing it a little bit faster. Here we go

Open, shut them, open, shut them
Give a little clap
Open, shut them, open, shut them
Lay them in your lap
Creep them, creep them, creep them
Right up to your chin
Open up your little mouth
*Gasp*
But do not let them in
