Curlylocks flying in the air

Waving to everyone out there

Well, everyone, let's have some more fun together
Can you put one hand up in the air?
And let's all wave hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Welcome to the Lachy Wiggle show
G'day, g'day, we're on our way
For some adventure and play
And today it feels like a singing and dancing day
Would you like to sing and dance together?
You would?
Well, here we go

Singing and dancing is so much fun
We are all together, the time has come
Can you wave your hand hello?
It's the Lachy Wiggle show
So let's all wave hello (Lachy Wiggle)
