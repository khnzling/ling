I was looking out my window
Late the other night
She was sitting in the garden
And gave me such a fright
Eating all mum's roses
There in the moonlight
It was Dorothy the Dinosaur
I knew that if Mum saw her
She'd never let her stay
A dinosaur as big as that
Needs feeding night and day
I'd have to find a place
Where I could hide her away
Dorothy the Dinosaur

I knew that she was so big
That she'd soon be found
My mother called the dog catcher
He came around
When he laid his eyes on her
He fell to the ground
'Now I take it, that's Dorothy the Dinosaur'

They called up the police
To take her right away
They called up the zoo
To find a place to stay
I said they couldn't take her
I said 'No way
That's Dorothy the Dinosaur'
("That's me")
