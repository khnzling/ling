(What's next, Greg? What's next?)

Can you stand on one foot and shake your hands?
(Oh, boy. That's hard!)
Can you stand on one foot and shake your hands?

Now, we're gonna go up then go down
Get back up and turn around
Can you stand on one foot and shake your hands?
(What's next, Greg? What's next?)

Can you point your fingers and do the twist?
(Pointy, pointy, pointy)
Can you point your fingers and do the twist?

Now, we're gonna go up then go down
Get back up and turn around
Can you point your fingers and do the twist?
