"Ho-Ho-Ho! Here I go. Ho-Ho! Ho-Ho!"

Go, Santa, go
You've got such a long way to go
Go, Santa, go
Go-go, go-go
(Go) Call the reindeer
(Go) Get ready
(Go-go) And away you go
Go, Santa, go
Go-go-go
Go, Santa, go

"Ho-Ho-Ho, here I go. Ho-Ho-Ho"

Go, Santa, go
All the way from the North Pole
Go, Santa, go
Go-go, go-go
(Go) Through the jungle
(Go) Through the desert
(Go-go) Through the winter snow
Go, Santa, go
Go-go-go
Go, Santa, go

"Here I go, Ho-Ho-Ho. Ho-Ho-Ho"

Long white beard with a face so happy and cheerful
Come on Rudolf, fast as you can
We've got presents here for everyone in the land
Ho-Ho

Go, Santa, go
You've got such a long way to go
Go, Santa, go
Go-go, go-go
(Go) Call the reindeer
(Go) Get ready
(Go-go) And away you go
Go, Santa, go
Go-go-go-ah
Go, Santa, go

"Here I go, Ho-Ho-Ho! Here I go, Ho-Ho-Ho!"
