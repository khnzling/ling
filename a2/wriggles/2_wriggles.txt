Let's shake our sillies out

We're going to shake, shake, shake my sillies out
Shake, shake, shake my sillies out
Shake, shake, shake my sillies out
Wibble our wobbles away
Well we've shaken our sillies out, how about we nod our noddies out?

We're going to nod, nod, nod our noddies out
Nod, nod, nod our noddies out
Nod, nod, nod our noddies out
Wibble our wobbles away
Now can we clap our crazies out? Let's all clap

We're going to clap, clap, clap our crazies out
Clap, clap, clap our crazies out
Clap, clap, clap our crazies out
Wibble our wobbles away
Can you show me how high you can jump? Let's all jump

We're going to jump, jump, jump our jiggles out
Jump, jump, jump our jiggles out
Jump, jump, jump our jiggles out
Wibble our wobbles away
Well all that jumping made us really tired, let's have a stretch and a yawn

We're going to stretch, yawn, stretch and yawn again
Stretch, yawn, stretch and yawn again
Stretch, yawn, stretch and yawn again
Wibble our wobbles away
Hey
