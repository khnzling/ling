Miss Polly had a dolly who was sick, sick, sick
So she called for the doctor to come quick, quick, quick
The doctor came with his bag and his hat
And he knocked on the door with a rat-a-tat-tat
He looked at the dolly and he shook his head
And he said

Miss Polly, put her straight to bed

He wrote on a paper for a pill, pill, pill

Iâ€™ll be back in the morning with my bill, bill, bill
